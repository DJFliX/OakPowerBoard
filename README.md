# OakPowerBoard
A Power Consumption board using the TCRT5000 to count pulses. The board is intended as a shield for DigiStump's Oak board. Check it out [here](http://digistump.com/oak/)!

##How does it look?
Great question, I've made screenshots of the board I sent to OSH-Park:

##Does it even work?
I don't know. I'm gonna find out as soon as my board arrive :).
